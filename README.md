# About
City Sim is a simulation where player can observe NPCs (non–player characters) who follow the rules of the road and interacts with each other. The simulation features a detailed urban environment with roads, crosswalks, sidewalks, buildings and green areas. NPCs can walk everywhere except road. The City Sim project was developed by the Triple Cat team as a hackathon case.
# Inspection
User can move camera using WASD and rotate with mouse to inspect city and npcs
# Navmesh
We’ve used navmesh to assign areas to adjust areas where npcs can walk

# Npc interaction
Triggers a conversation event between NPCs when they collide. In a collision with a 10% chance, if both NPCs are free, they start a conversation, stop, and display a conversation sign above them.
